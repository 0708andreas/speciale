\section*{Introduction}
Gröbner bases of ideals in multivariate polynomial rings are a vital tool when doing computational algebra and computational algebraic geometry. They often feature as an intermidiary step in all sorts of problems, ranging from intersecting ideals and solving polynomial equations, to backwards kinematics and determining the behaviour of chemical reaction networks\cite{IVA}. As such, the study of Gröbner bases have developed into a large field of its own.

In some situations, we may be interested in not just one ideal, but a family of ideals. For example we could ask which pairs of circles with fixed centers have exactly one intersection point, i.e.\ for which values of $r_{1}$ and $r_{2}$ we have $\V(x^{2} + y^{2} - r_{1}^{1}, (x - 1)^{2} + (y - 1)^{2} - r_{2}^{2})| = 1$. Or we might have a fixed algebraic curve, and we want to calculate the distance between a point and the curve. This can be done by computing a Gröbner basis for a system of equations, given by the Lagrange multipliers. Keeping the coordinates of the point as parameters, we would like to quickly compute this distance for many points. From a purely mathematical view, we might be interested in the behaviour of a Gröbner basis as we change the base ring.

Volker Weispfenning introduced the notion of a comprehensive Gröbner basis in \cite{Weispfenning} in 1992 and demonstrated an algorithm to compute them. He also gave some results on the computational complexity of this algorithm as well as some early applications. However, the computation of Gröbner bases, and by extension comprehensive Gröbner bases, is a difficult problem. Many optimizations and heuristics exist, which means the computation of Gröbner bases should be performed using highly optimized software. Reimplementing all this for comprehensive Gröbner bases might not be feasible. I 2006, Suzuki and Sato produced an algorithm for computing comprehensive Gröbner bases, that utilize existing software for computing Gröbner bases. Even though the theoretical complexity didn't change, the execution time certainly did. Kapur, Sun and Wang improved on this algorithm in 2010 \cite{KAPUR201327}\cite{10.1145/1837934.1837946}.

After comprehensive Gröbner bases were established, the search began for a unique object, a parametric analogue of the reduced Gröbner basis. Weispfenning introduced what he called a canonical comprehensive Gröbner basis in \cite{WEISPFENNING2003669}, which only depends on the ideal and the monomial order on the variables and the parameters. However, no object comparable to the reduced Gröbner basis, which was independent of assumptions on the ground ring was found until Michael Wibmer introduced Gröbner covers in \cite{grb_covers}. By drawing on machinery from modern algebraic geometry, including the language of sheaves and schemes, he found a parametric way of describing the reduced Gröbner basis of every specialization of the ideal in question. This rather abstract paper was quickly followed up by \cite{MONTES20101391}, which described an algorithm to compute Gröbner covers. It should be noted, that even though the canonical Gröbner cover described by Wibmer is unique in a mathematical sense, there is no canonical, finite description of it, without adding in some assumptions on the base ring.

The focus of this paper is to serve as an introduction to comprehensive Gröbner bases. First, we establish comprehensive Gröbner bases, Gröbner systems and some initial results on parametric Gröbner bases. In particular, a fundamental theorem by Kalkbrener\cite{Kalkbrener} on when a Gröbner basis specializes to a Gröbner basis, as well as pseudo-division. Then, we cover the algorithm introduced by Suzuki and Sato. From here, we move on to Gröbner covers as introduced by Wibmer, to give an introduction into this, quite different framing of parametric Gröbner bases. We tie this theory together the Suzuki-Sato algorithm, and provide plenty of examples to help get a feeling for the subject. Finally, we cover some applications of parametric Gröbner bases and Gröbner covers.

We purposefully do not cover Kapur, Sun and Wangs algorithm nor the implementation of Wibmers theory by Antonio Montes\cite{MONTES20101391}. These are seen as refinements of the material already covered, and covering them would make the introduction needlessly complex. Instead, we focus on tying the algorithm of Suzuki and Sato to the theory of Wibmer, which is how modern implementations of comprehensive Gröbner bases are implemented, but which doesn't seem to be described in detail in the literature.

New contributions of this project include
\begin{itemize}
  \item Fixing edge-case bugs in the pseudo-code in \cite{ss_algo}
  \item Modifying the Suzuki-Sato algorithm to produce Gröbner covers
  \item Placing pseudo-division as a central tool of Gröbner covers and comprehensive Gröbner bases
  \item Identifying a false theorem in \cite{sturmfels} and fixing it using comprehensive Gröbner bases
  \item A new implementation of comprehensive Gröbner bases in the Julia programming language with demonstrations of their applications
\end{itemize}
