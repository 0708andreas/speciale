# Parametric Gröbner bases -- Geometry & applications

This repository contains my masters project in mathematics from Aarhus University, spring 2024, done under supervision of Niels Lauritzen. The finished report can be found in `project.pdf` in this repo.

Besides the report, this project resulted in two articles
 - _Gröbner bases and final polynomials_, [https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.
16217]
 - _Erratum to: Computational algebraic geometry of projective
configurations_ in Journal of Symbolic Computations (accepted, not
yet published

Finally, the code developed for this project can be found at [https://github.com/0708andreas/ParametricGroebnerBases.jl].

I am very grateful to my supervisor Niels Lauritzen for his help and guidance, to Aarhus University as a whole, and to all my friends and family who distracted me from this project. Thank you.
