abstract = {Let K be an integral domain and let S be the polynomial ring K[U1,.., Um; X1,.., Xn]. For any finite F ⊆ S, we construct a comprehensive Gröbner basis of the ideal Id(F), i.e. a finite ideal basis of Id(F) that is a Gröbner basis of Id(F) in K′[X1, …, Xn] for every specialization of the parameters U1, …, Um in an arbitrary field K1. We show that this construction can be performed with the same worst case degree bounds in the main variables Xi, as for ordinary Gröbner bases; moreover, examples computed in an ALDES/SAC-2 implementation show that the construction is of practical value. Comprehensive Gröbner bases admit numerous applications to parametric problems in algebraic geometry; in particular, they yield a fast elimination of quantifier-blocks in algebraically closed fields.}

title = "A simple algorithm to compute comprehensive Gr{\"o}bner bases using Gr{\"o}bner bases",
abstract = "We introduce a simple algorithm to compute comprehensive Gr{\"o}bner bases. It requires only computations of reduced Gr{\"o}bner bases in polynomial rings over ground fields. It is so simple that we can easily implement it on any computer algebra system that has a routine to compute reduced Gr{\"o}bner bases. Our implementations on several computer algebra systems show that it is also sufficiently fast comparing with other existing algorithms.",
